So it begins...

Free Food Club aims to be:
1. A platform to give food to those who may be in need
2. To allow neighbours a simple way to advertise food they have grown
3. A simple way to find free food available in your neighbourhood.

A core idea in the project is that food is always kept free for all and so can help reduce the stigma of those who may be struggling to feed themselves.

Over time I hope that the app will be used by:
1. Early adopters that are passionate about growing food
2. Communities that already give or trade food but don't yet have a platform that makes this easy to manage
3. Organisations such as food banks, supermarkets, restaurants that would otherwise have to throw food away
